The aim of this code is to compare the performance of two types of convolutional neural networks (defined in the files **Convolutional1.py** and **Convolutional2.py**) and support vector machines (defined in **svm.py**) in the task of distinguishing the jet of a QCD background and that of a W boson at the LHC.

More detailed info on the problem, the architectures and the results are found in **Report.pdf**
